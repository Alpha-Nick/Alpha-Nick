- 👋 Hi, I’m @Alpha-Nick
- 👀 I’m interested in embedding code inside the Espressif ESP32 and ESP8285 SoC devices
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to install the Eclipse, or MSVS extention fo allow me to create code for the device.
- 💞️ I’m not currently looking to collabore on anything, but let's not rule that out
- 📫 How to reach me ... Not entered yet.

Based in the UK. NEW to GitHub, and all it's potential.
Initially directed here from Espressif to grab their software kernels.

I hope to meet some of you as time goes on. . . . 
Oh, and as you can see from the number times I have eddited this file. . I CAN'T type well!

Nick
